Computer Science courses can be difficult to enroll in as an exchange student and are only available at the 3rd and 4th year level and therefore only suitable for students who have already completed 2 or 3 years of a Computer Science degree.

Students who wish to take units within Engineering, are strongly advised to apply for a year-long placement as many of the units in these departments are taught over the full academic year.

Chemistry courses are only open to full-year exchange students (not available for single semester).

Psychology is taught as an experimental science rather than a social science at Bristol. Students taking Psychology units are generally required to have a strong background in Chemistry, Biology and Neuroscience.
