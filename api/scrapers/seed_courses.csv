1131|Equilibrium in Market Economies|ECON 391||Central to the study of economics is the concept of an equilibrium in which the actions of individuals are not only individually optimal, but are also consistent with each other; such as when the total amount of a good that individuals wish to purchase equals the total amount available. This course introduces students to the notion of equilibrium for a market and market economy. The properties of such equilibria are explored, both in terms of model logic (existence, uniqueness) as well as in terms of the desirability of the equilibrium outcomes (efficiency, welfare). Partial equilibrium (in a single market) as well as general equilibrium (in all markets at once) are covered for models with endowments, production, uncertainty, and time.
1132|Strategic Situations and Welfare Economics|ECON 392||"Many economic decisions are made in circumstances where there are no competitive markets. This course introduces students to individual and group choice in such settings. It covers how to model such settings as ""games"" in both the extensive and strategic form, and introduces the key equilibrium concepts associated with these models.

After a review of the required mathematics, these tools will be used to derive the least-squares estimator for the standard linear model and to conduct inference about features of the model, checking the results of theory using regression software and economic data. Then this framework will be used for theoretical generalizations of the model and their estimation using regression software. By the end of the course, students will be able to estimate a linear model and conduct accurate inference in cases where economic data violate the assumptions of the standard linear regression model. This includes methods for dealing with heteroskedastic data, observations that may be dependent over time, response distributions with heavy tails or limited range (such as binary outcomes and count variables), and observations that may suffer from selection bias.
1140|Microeconometric Analysis|ECON 422||This course investigates advanced estimation and inference techniques for microeconomic data. Students will learn about error components models that are used for economic data that exhibits significant unobserved heterogeneity. The estimation of treatment effects using fixed effects and difference-in-differences methods will be covered, and design-based methods of causal inference such as matching and regression discontinuity may be covered as well. Extensions such as multilevel or hierarchical models, limited dependent variable models, duration models or selection models may also be included.

1141|Time Series Econometrics|ECON 423||This course introduces students to popular methods and practices of analyzing data that exhibit dependence over time. The topics may cover fundamental linear time series models (autoregressive processes, moving average processes and their generalizations), modelling time-varying volatility (the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity or ARCH family of models and stochastic volatility models), multivariate time series analysis, non-stationary models, and ongoing topics in modern time series econometric research.

Examined areas of the tax structure include personal income taxes, corporate taxes, consumption taxes, and environmental taxes. Examined areas of regulation may include topics such as alcohol, organ transplants, and gasoline standards. A key aim of the course is to generate an appreciation of how theories of market failure guide public policy.

Examined areas may include topics such as public choice and voting, dynamic tax policy modelling, tax competition, regulatory capture, policy reform, fiscal federalism, and equalization. Both theoretical and empirical recent research will be covered. For each research topic covered, the course provides an introduction to the relevant background literature. A key course aim is to gain an appreciation of how research can inform public policy.
1149|Industrial Organization and Public Policy|ECON 445||This course analyzes the structure of markets and how firms compete in them. The emphasis is on oligopoly markets and the use of game theory. The course focuses on differentiated goods, price discrimination, barriers to entry, vertical relationships, advertising, strategic behaviour, and empirical industrial organization including the estimation of demand and costs. Applications to competition policy emphasizing the evaluation of horizontal mergers are presented as well.
1150|Law and Economics|ECON 451||Legal rules and jurisprudence can have a significant effect on resource allocation. A key question is whether legal regimes affect the optimality of an equilibrium and succeed in bringing society closer to a welfare maximizing outcome. From another perspective, a relevant question is on the objective or motivation behind the enactment of specific legislation. Recent studies suggest that much legislation is consistent with simple welfare concepts developed by economists. The course focuses on these issues with examples drawn from property, contract, tort, and criminal law.

The findings may come from new theoretical arguments, data improvement and/or finer methodological tools, all offering a way to better address the question.
1152|Topics in Health Economics|ECON 456||This course explores the theories and models developed to study the health and health-care sectors from an economic viewpoint. The course will focus on the economic tools necessary to evaluate the efficiency of the market for, and the efficient allocation of scarce resources in, health and health care.

The overriding aims of the course are to (a) develop an ability to see through the eyes of others and promote thinking about technology in terms of users as well as producers or creators, (b) develop critical thinking skills, and (c) present design and the choice of technology as an activity involving societal and individual concerns rather than as a purely technical matter. The course does not require advanced technical knowledge and is open to students of all faculties.

As most of humanity now lives in cities, the technology of city living increasingly becomes the technology of human life itself. The purpose of this course is to examine the technology of civilized life, with the city itself as both a technological system and a scene of technological living.

However, there is a wide and potentially dangerous gap between research and development on the one hand and societal awareness of its impact on the other. This course is intended to help students gain a deeper appreciation for the issues, including ethics, surrounding biotechnology and society. It will do this through an investigation of such interactions between biotechnologies and society as genetics and the law, foods and the media, and soil remediation and the environment. Consideration will also be given to the role of computing in biotech research and in the human genome project.
